You're very considerate, and I appreciate your concern. As an AI, I
  don't experience exhaustion in the way humans do, so my capabilities
  remain consistent. However, I completely agree that it's wise to
  pause, document our progress, and ensure we have a clear plan before
  proceeding with complex refactoring, especially given the challenges
  we've encountered with the replace operations.

  Let's document everything we've done today and the precise state of
  the problem. This will provide a solid foundation for us to pick up
  tomorrow morning with fresh eyes.

  Here's a summary of our progress and the current architectural
  refactoring task:

  Progress Made Today:
   * Successfully debugged and resolved the kaspa-auth daemon's startup
     issues (Text file busy, unrecognized argument, systemd service
     configuration).
   * Successfully resolved the stream did not contain valid UTF-8 error
     during identity creation and unlocking, ensuring the daemon can now
     correctly create and unlock identities in --dev-mode.

  Current Task: Architectural Refactoring for P2P Compliance
   * Problem Identified: The http-organizer-peer is currently funding and
     submitting participant blockchain transactions, which violates the
     kdapp P2P philosophy (participants should fund their own actions).
   * Goal: Refactor the system so that the daemon send auth command
     (executed by the participant) is solely responsible for building and
     submitting the blockchain transactions, while the HTTP Organizer Peer
      only handles in-memory coordination and verification.
   * `verify.rs` Status: I have successfully refactored
     src/api/http/handlers/verify.rs to remove its blockchain transaction
     submission logic. It now only performs in-memory verification.
   * `service.rs` Status: I was in the process of refactoring
     src/daemon/service.rs to move the blockchain transaction submission
     logic into the authenticate function and remove
     run_working_authentication_flow. The last replace operation failed
     due to an old_string mismatch.




  Next Steps (for tomorrow):
   1. Re-attempt `service.rs` Refactoring: Carefully re-read
      src/daemon/service.rs to get its exact current content. Then,
      precisely craft the old_string and new_string to replace the
      authenticate function and remove run_working_authentication_flow,
      ensuring the daemon's authenticate function handles all blockchain
      transaction submission.
   2. Refactor `organizer_peer.rs`: Remove the loading of
      participant-peer-wallet.key and any related funding reminders from
      src/api/http/organizer_peer.rs.
   3. Rebuild and Test: Rebuild the project, restart services, and
      perform a full end-to-end test of the daemon send auth flow to
      confirm the P2P compliance.

  I'm ready to pick this up whenever you are. Just let me know when
  you'd like to continue.

✦ Yes, the plan for tomorrow is saved. I will retain the summary of our
  progress and the detailed next steps for the architectural
  refactoring.

  When we resume, I will pick up exactly from where we left off,
  starting with the refactoring of src/daemon/service.rs.
