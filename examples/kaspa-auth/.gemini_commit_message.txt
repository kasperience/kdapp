feat: Capture current state with persistent UTF-8 key handling issue

This commit captures the current development state, including all modifications and newly added files.

**Current Constraint:**
- The `daemon send create` command, when in `--dev-mode`, writes the private key to `.kaspa-auth/testuser.key` as raw binary data.
- The `daemon send unlock` command, when in `--dev-mode`, attempts to read this key file as a UTF-8 string, leading to a `stream did not contain valid UTF-8` error.
- This indicates a mismatch in key storage/retrieval logic within `src/utils/keychain.rs` and `src/daemon/service.rs` when `dev_mode` is active.

**Next Steps:**
- Address the key encoding/decoding mismatch to ensure `create` and `unlock` are compatible in `--dev-mode` (likely by ensuring hex encoding/decoding for file-based keys).
