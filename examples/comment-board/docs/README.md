# üìö Comment-Board Documentation

This directory contains technical documentation, proofs, and validation materials for the kdapp comment-board project.

## üìÅ Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation
- **`technical-validation.md`** - External validation of UTXO locking feasibility 
- **`implementation-roadmap.md`** - Phase 1.1 ‚Üí 1.2 ‚Üí 2.0 development path (includes ‚ÄúUTXO Locking + Multisig: Current Status‚Äù)
- **`security-analysis.md`** - Security considerations and threat model
- **`performance-benchmarks.md`** - Performance testing and optimization results

### External Proofs & Validations  
- **`deepwiki-assessment.md`** - DeepWiki technical validation of rusty-kaspa integration
- **`community-feedback.md`** - Community responses and expert reviews
- **`compliance-analysis.md`** - Regulatory and compliance considerations

### Technical References
- **`rusty-kaspa-integration.md`** - Detailed integration with Kaspa APIs
- **`kdapp-framework-usage.md`** - How we leverage kdapp engine capabilities
- **`utxo-locking-mechanisms.md`** - Deep dive into UTXO management strategies

### Decision Records
- **`architecture-decisions/`** - ADRs documenting major technical decisions
- Notable: ADR-001 (UTXO Locking Approach), ADR-002 (Shared Policy Helpers/commons)
- **`security-decisions/`** - Security-specific architectural choices
- **`performance-decisions/`** - Performance optimization decisions

## üéØ Why This Matters

As a **revolutionary decentralized social platform** with economic incentives, proper documentation serves multiple purposes:

1. **Technical Credibility**: Prove the approach is technically sound
2. **Community Trust**: Show transparent development process  
3. **Developer Onboarding**: Help contributors understand design decisions
4. **Security Audit**: Provide materials for security reviews
5. **Academic Reference**: Support research and academic validation

## üìù Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. **Include sources**: Always cite external validations and proofs
2. **Version decisions**: Track why and when technical choices were made
3. **Performance data**: Include benchmarks and testing results
4. **Security analysis**: Document security implications of design choices
5. **Community feedback**: Capture expert opinions and community responses
