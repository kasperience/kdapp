## 📋 Phase 1.1: Proof of Concept (COMPLETE)

### 🎯 **Goal**: Prove economic incentive model works
### ✅ **Achievements**:
- **Simulated bond transactions** with deterministic IDs
- **Application-layer UTXO tracking** with locked vs available balance
- **Time-based unlock mechanism** (10-minute testing period)
- **Basic comment-bond integration** with room rules
- **Working CLI interface** with balance, unlock, and bond commands

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**:
```rust
// Phase 1.1: Simulated transaction approach
let simulated_tx_id = format!("bond_tx_{}_{}", comment_id, current_time());
```

### 📊 **Results**:
- ✅ Economic model validated - bonds prevent spam effectively
- ✅ User experience flow confirmed - intuitive bond posting/unlocking
- ✅ Application-layer tracking works - no real fund loss during testing
- ✅ Integration with kdapp engine successful

## 🔐 Phase 1.2: Real Blockchain Integration (COMPLETE)

### 🎯 **Goal**: Bridge to real Kaspa blockchain transactions
### ✅ **Achievements**:
- **Real kdapp TransactionGenerator** usage for bond creation
- **Actual blockchain submission** via `submit_transaction()` API
- **Confirmation tracking** with bond status monitoring  
- **Proof transactions** that create on-chain evidence without consuming full bond
- **Episode expiration bug fixes** - contracts now last until 2033+

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**:
```rust
// Phase 1.2: Real transaction approach
let generator = TransactionGenerator::new(self.keypair, PATTERN, PREFIX);
let bond_tx = generator.build_transaction(&utxos, proof_amount, 1, &address, payload);
let tx_id = self.kaspad.submit_transaction((&bond_tx).into(), false).await?;
```

### 📊 **Results**:
- ✅ **DeepWiki validation**: "Definitely doable, built on solid rusty-kaspa foundations"
- ✅ **Real transactions**: Creating actual blockchain evidence of economic commitment
- ✅ **Fund preservation**: Proof transactions use minimal amounts, preserve user funds
- ✅ **Confirmation tracking**: Real-time monitoring of bond transaction status
- ✅ **UTXO management**: Proper integration with Kaspa's UTXO model

## 🚀 Phase 2.0: True UTXO Locking (NEXT)

### 🎯 **Goal**: Implement programmable UTXO time-locks
### 📋 **Planned Features**:
- **Script-based locking** with actual spending constraints
- **True time-lock conditions** that prevent spending until unlock time
- **Multi-signature release** for dispute resolution
- **Automated unlocking** via smart contract conditions
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (CLI + Web interface)

### 🔧 **Technical Design**:
```rust
// Phase 2.0: True UTXO script-based locking
let lock_script = create_timelock_script(
    unlock_time,
    user_pubkey,
    moderator_pubkeys,
    dispute_conditions
);
let locked_utxo = create_utxo_with_script(bond_amount, lock_script);
```

### 🎯 **Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Funds truly locked - cannot be spent even by user until conditions met
- [ ] Automated unlock after time period with no disputes
- [ ] Multi-signature escape hatch for moderation decisions
- [ ] Zero trust required - all rules enforced by blockchain scripts

## 📌 UTXO Locking + Multisig: Current Status

- Descriptor plumbing: 80% — `script_bytes` wiring behind a feature flag; episodes can inspect when available.
- Standard script bonds: 30% — experimental path exists; public nodes reject non‑standard scripts. Next: standard, node‑accepted templates.
- Episode enforcement: 50% — policy mismatch rejection works; needs broader coverage and removal of feature gating.
- Wallet/UTXO manager (script outputs): 30% — solid for P2PK; need builder/signing for standard scripts and change handling.
- Multisig orchestration: 10–20% — not implemented. Requires n‑of‑m key mgmt, signature collection/aggregation, and rollback flows.
- E2E tests (locking/reorg/rollback): 20% — scaffolding exists; contract scenarios missing.

Overall: ~35–45% toward “full on‑chain UTXO locking with multisig” across infra + examples. Single‑sig standard script bonding: ~1–2 weeks focused work. Multisig: +2–4 weeks for orchestration/UX/tests, assuming no node policy blockers.

## 🏛️ Phase 3.0: Full Episode Contracts (FUTURE)

### 🎯 **Goal**: Complete decentralized moderation platform
### 📋 **Planned Features**:
- **Room-specific governance** with custom rules and penalties
- **Community voting** on content moderation decisions
- **Reputation systems** with earned privileges and reduced bond requirements  
- **Arbitration panels** with multi-signature dispute resolution
- **Economic incentives** - quality rewards from penalty pools

### 🏗️ **Architecture Vision**:
```rust
pub struct CommentRoomEpisode {
    pub room_rules: RoomRules,           // Custom governance per room
    pub moderators: Vec<PubKey>,         // Elected arbitration panel
    pub penalty_pool: u64,               // Forfeited bonds → quality rewards
    pub reputation_scores: HashMap<String, i32>, // Earned trust scores
    pub voting_results: HashMap<u64, VoteResult>, // Democratic decisions
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Phase 1.2 Validation
- [x] **Real transaction creation** - bonds create blockchain evidence
- [x] **Fund preservation** - proof transactions don't consume user balance
- [x] **Confirmation tracking** - real-time bond status monitoring
- [x] **Episode longevity** - contracts no longer expire immediately
- [x] **Multi-user testing** - organizer + participant scenarios

### Phase 2.0 Testing Plan
- [ ] **Script validation** - ensure time-locks actually prevent spending
- [ ] **Cross-platform testing** - CLI, web, and mobile interfaces
- [ ] **Security audit** - professional review of locking mechanisms
- [ ] **Performance benchmarking** - transaction throughput and confirmation times
- [ ] **Economic simulation** - game theory analysis of incentive structures
