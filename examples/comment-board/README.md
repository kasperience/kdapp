# Comment Board - TRUE P2P Group Chat! 🎉

**Simple architecture**: One shared episode, everyone pays for their own transactions, no wallet draining!

## 🚀 Features - The CORRECT Way!

- **🎯 One Episode, Many Wallets** - Shared room state, individual payments
- **💰 Fair Economics** - You pay for your own comments, nobody can drain others
- **🔐 Your Kaspa Key = Your Identity** - No separate comment keys needed!
- **📺 Real-time Updates** - Everyone sees all comments instantly
- **⚡ Pure kdapp Architecture** - Exactly how the framework was designed
- **🌐 Unlimited Participants** - Anyone can join any room

## 🎮 Usage - Simple & Powerful!

### 🆕 Create New Room (Organizer)
```bash
# Create room with your Kaspa wallet
cargo run --bin comment-board -- --kaspa-private-key <your-kaspa-key>

# Output: "🚀 Creating new room with Episode ID: 123456789"
# Share this Episode ID with friends!
```

### 👥 Join Existing Room (Participants)  
```bash
# Join room with your OWN Kaspa wallet (works anytime!)
cargo run --bin comment-board -- --kaspa-private-key <your-kaspa-key> --room-episode-id 123456789

# The app automatically creates a local episode to enable participation
# You pay for your own comments with your wallet
# Your Kaspa public key becomes your username
```

### 🎯 How It Works Now
- **Organizer**: Creates Episode with their wallet → Pays creation fee
- **Participants**: Join by creating local episode with same ID → Each pays their own fees
- **Everyone**: Uses their Kaspa key as identity → Comments visible to all
- **Smart Fix**: Participants can join existing rooms anytime (local episode creation)

### 💬 Party Commands
- Type any text → Comment appears for EVERYONE in the room
- Type `quit` → Leave the room (but comments stay forever!)
- Anyone can join at any time with the Episode ID

## 🎪 How It Actually Works - CORRECT kdapp Architecture

### The Simple Truth
1. **Organizer** creates Episode with their wallet → Pays creation fee
2. **Participants** join by sending commands to same Episode ID → Each pays their own fees
3. **Everyone** uses their Kaspa key as identity → No separate keys!
4. **Episode state** is shared → All comments visible to everyone

### Real Example Flow - Fair Economics
```
Alice (Organizer): Creates Episode 12345 → Pays ~0.001 TKAS creation fee
Bob (Participant):  Joins Episode 12345 → Pays ~0.001 TKAS to join
Carol (Participant): Joins Episode 12345 → Pays ~0.001 TKAS to join  
Dave (Participant):  Joins Episode 12345 → Pays ~0.001 TKAS to join

Everyone comments: Each person pays ~0.001 TKAS per comment
Result: Alice paid ~0.001 TKAS total, not drained by others! ✅
```
