feat(auth): Implement Day 1 kaspa-auth episode

This commit introduces the initial `kaspa-auth` example, fulfilling the "Day 1" requirements from the project roadmap.

It includes:
- A `simple_auth_episode` with `RequestChallenge` and `SubmitResponse` commands.
- A local CLI (`test-episode`) to verify the core authentication logic without network dependencies.
- An interactive CLI demo (`demo`) to simulate the two-party authentication flow.
- All code is contained within the `examples/kaspa-auth` directory, following the project's structural guidelines.

This provides a solid, testable foundation for the next phase of Kaspa network integration.

Also includes `GEMINI.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for educational context on the development process.
